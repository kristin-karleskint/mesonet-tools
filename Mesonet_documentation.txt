MDF/MTS Files

Mesonet MDF and MTS files are space delimited files used to display data in WeatherScope.  MDF files display data for all stations for a given time, while MTS files display data for 1 station for a given UTC day.  This is the standard file format used for Mesonet data.

 

File Header

The MDF/MTS header consists of 3 lines.  The first line of the file contains copyright information.  The second line lists the number of variables in the file (i.e., number of columns not including STID, STNM, and TIME), year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.  The date is listed in UTC and serves as the base time for the data file.  The third line lists the variable ID for each data column.

 

Special Notes

-The 0000 UTC observation stores the previous day's accumulated rainfall.

-Frozen precipitation is measured at the time of thaw.  Some snowmelt may never be observed due to factors including sublimation and blowing snow.

-Data quality is frequently re-assessed.  On rare occasions, some quality assurance flags may change in the months following your data request.

-For use of soil moisture measurements, see the Soil Moisture document.

 

Variables

Name	ID	Unit	Description
Station ID	STID	 	Station ID
Station Number	STNM	 	Station Number
Time	TIME	minutes after base time	Minutes after base time (typically 0000 UTC)
Relative Humidity	RELH	percent	5-minute averaged relative humidity at 1.5m.
Air Temperature	TAIR	degrees Celsius	5-minute averaged air temperature at 1.5m.
Wind Speed	WSPD	meters per second	5-minute averaged wind speed at 10m.
Wind Vector	WVEC	meters per second	5-minute averaged wind velocity (speed and direction accounted for) at 10m.
Wind Direction	WDIR	degrees	5-minute averaged wind direction at 10m.
Wind Direction Standard Deviation	WDSD	degrees	Standard deviation of wind direction during the 5-minute interval.
Wind Speed Standard Deviation	WSSD	meters per second	Standard deviation of wind speed during the 5-minute interval.
Maximum Wind Speed	WMAX	meters per second	Highest 3-second wind speed at 10m sample.
Precipitation	RAIN	millimeters	Liquid precipitation accumulation since 0000 UTC. Frozen precipitation cannot be recorded until it melts; therefore, precipitation from snow may not be recorded until several days after the snow event.
Station Atmospheric Pressure	PRES	millibars	5-minute averaged atmospheric pressure.
Solar Radiation	SRAD	watts per square meter	5-minute averaged downwelling global solar radiation.
Air Temperature at 9m	TA9M	degrees Celsius	5-minute averaged air temperature at 9m
2m Wind Speed	WS2M	meters per second	5-minute averaged wind speed at 2m
Temperature Under Native Vegetation at 10cm	TS10	degrees Celsius	15-minute averaged temperature under native vegetation at 10cm.
Temperature Under Bare Soil at 10cm	TB10	degrees Celsius	15-minute averaged temperature under bare soil at 10cm.
Temperature Under Native Vegetation at 5cm	TS05	degrees Celsius	15-minute averaged temperature under native vegetation at 5cm.
Temperature Under Bare Soil at 5cm	TB05	degrees Celsius	15-minute averaged temperature under bare soil at 5cm. This variable is only available prior to December 1, 2013.
Temperature Under Native Vegetation at 25cm	TS25	degrees Celsius	15-minute averaged temperature under native vegetation at 25cm. This variable is only available after and including December 1, 2013.
Temperature Under Native Vegetation at 30cm	TS30	degrees Celsius	15-minute averaged temperature under native vegetation at 30cm. This variable is only available prior to December 1, 2013.
Temperature Under Native Vegetation at 60cm	TS60	degrees Celsius	15-minute averaged temperature under native vegetation at 60cm. This variable is only available after and including December 1, 2013.
Soil Moisture Calibrated Delta-T at 5cm	TR05	degrees Celsius	Calibrated change in temperature of soil over time after a heat pulse is introduced. Used to calculate soil water potential, fractional water index, or volumetric water.
Soil Moisture Calibrated Delta-T at 25cm	TR25	degrees Celsius	Calibrated change in temperature of soil over time after a heat pulse is introduced. Used to calculate soil water potential, fractional water index, or volumetric water.
Soil Moisture Calibrated Delta-T at 60cm	TR60	degrees Celsius	Calibrated change in temperature of soil over time after a heat pulse is introduced. Used to calculate soil water potential, fractional water index, or volumetric water.
 

 

Missing Data Values

Value	Description
-999	Data flagged as bad by quality assurance routines.
-998	Sensor not installed.
-997	Cannot compute value due to missing calibration coefficient(s).
-996	Station did not report (missing).
-995	Data not reported on this time interval (e.g., soil temperature only reports every 15 minutes and is not available at 25 minutes after the hour).
-994	Value too wide to fit in column.
